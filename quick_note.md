good_:Open a file, returning an object of the [`file`](https://devdocs.io/python~2.7/library/functions#file) type described in section [File Objects](https://devdocs.io/python~2.7/library/stdtypes#bltin-file-objects). If the file cannot be opened, [`IOError`](https://devdocs.io/python~2.7/library/exceptions#exceptions.IOError) is raised. When opening a file, it’s preferable to use [`open()`](https://devdocs.io/python~2.7/library/functions#open) instead of invoking the [`file`](https://devdocs.io/python~2.7/library/functions#file) constructor directly.

The first two arguments are the same as for `stdio`’s `fopen()`: _name_ is the file name to be opened, and _mode_ is a string indicating how the file is to be opened.

The most commonly-used values of _mode_ are `'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and `'a'` for appending (which on _some_ Unix systems means that _all_ writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). If _mode_ is omitted, it defaults to `'r'`. The default is to use text mode, which may convert `' '` characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back on reading. Thus, when opening a binary file, you should append `'b'` to the _mode_ value to open the file in binary mode, which will improve portability. (Appending `'b'` is useful even on systems that don’t treat binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.) See below for more possible values of _mode_.

The optional _buffering_ argument specifies the file’s desired buffer size: 0 means unbuffered, 1 means line buffered, any other positive value means use a buffer of (approximately) that size (in bytes). A negative _buffering_ means to use the system default, which is usually line buffered for tty devices and fully buffered for other files. If omitted, the system default is used.

Modes `'r+'`, `'w+'` and `'a+'` open the file for updating (reading and writing); note that `'w+'` truncates the file. Append `'b'` to the mode to open the file in binary mode, on systems that differentiate between binary and text files; on systems that don’t have this distinction, adding the `'b'` has no effect.
